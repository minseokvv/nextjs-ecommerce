    -   Allow users to save products for later purchase.
    -   "My Wishlist" page in the user profile.

3.  **Advanced Search & Filtering**
    -   Filter by price range, category, color, size.
    -   Sort by popularity, newest, price (low/high).

4.  **Coupon & Discount System**
    -   Admin: Create coupons (fixed amount or percentage).
    -   User: Apply coupons at checkout.

## Phase 7: Deployment & Optimization

    -   Sitemap generation.
    -   Robots.txt configuration.

2.  **Performance Tuning**
